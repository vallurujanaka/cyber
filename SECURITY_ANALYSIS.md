## Security Implementation Details

### Encryption Implementation
```python
# AES-256-GCM encryption for data at rest
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
import base64
import os

def encrypt_data(data: str, key: str) -> str:
    salt = os.urandom(16)
    kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        length=32,
        salt=salt,
        iterations=100000,
    )
    key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(kdf.derive(key.encode()))
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    encrypted = fernet.encrypt(data.encode())
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(salt + encrypted).decode()
```

### Authentication System
```python
# JWT-based authentication with role validation
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi import HTTPException, Security
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer

security = HTTPBearer()

def create_jwt_token(user_id: str, roles: List[str]) -> str:
    payload = {
        "sub": user_id,
        "roles": roles,
        "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)
    }
    return jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm="HS256")

def verify_token(token: str) -> dict:
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Token expired")
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")
```

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE Analysis
1. **Spoofing**: Prevented by JWT authentication and signature validation
2. **Tampering**: Prevented by HMAC signatures and encrypted storage
3. **Repudiation**: Prevented by audit logging and non-repudiation mechanisms
4. **Information Disclosure**: Prevented by encryption and access controls
5. **Denial of Service**: Mitigated by rate limiting and resource management
6. **Elevation of Privilege**: Prevented by role-based access control

### OWASP Top 10 Mitigations
1. **Injection**: Parameterized queries, input validation
2. **Broken Authentication**: Strong password policies, MFA
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **XML External Entities**: XXE protection disabled
5. **Broken Access Control**: Role-based authorization
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Secure defaults, automated scanning
7. **Cross-Site Scripting**: Content Security Policy headers
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: Safe deserialization practices
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Regular dependency updates
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit logging
