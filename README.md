# Next-Generation Cybersecurity Threat Detection System

## Overview
A comprehensive, AI-powered cybersecurity threat detection system that combines real-time monitoring, machine learning analysis, and proactive defense mechanisms for enterprise-level security operations.

## Architecture
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Real-time ingestion of network traffic, logs, and threat intelligence feeds
- **Detection Engine**: Hybrid approach combining signature-based, anomaly detection, and ML models
- **Alerting & Reporting**: Real-time alerts with detailed classifications and mitigation advice
- **Dashboard**: SOC analyst interface with live threat feeds and visualization

## Key Features
- Real-time network traffic analysis (PCAP, NetFlow, logs)
- AI/ML threat detection (Random Forest, LSTM RNNs)
- Threat intelligence integration (MITRE ATT&CK, AlienVault OTX)
- Scalable architecture (Kafka, Spark, Kubernetes)
- Professional-grade security and compliance

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, GoLang
- **Frontend**: React, D3.js
- **Data Processing**: Apache Kafka, Spark
- **Storage**: Elasticsearch, MongoDB, Redis
- **ML Framework**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up environment variables
3. Run data ingestion: `python src/ingestion/ingestion_service.py`
4. Start detection engine: `python src/detection/detection_engine.py`
5. Launch dashboard: `cd dashboard && npm start`

## Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- NIST 800-53 alignment
- GDPR-ready data handling
- Zero-trust access controls
- Regular security audits
