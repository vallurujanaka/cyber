## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Malicious IP Detection
```
Source IP: 192.168.1.100 (malicious reputation)
Destination IP: 10.0.0.50
Protocol: TCP
Port: 80
Payload: 1024 bytes
```

**Expected Result**: 
- Threat Detected: Malicious IP
- Severity: Critical
- Confidence: 95%

### Scenario 2: SSH Brute Force Attempt
```
Source IP: 192.168.1.1
Destination IP: 10.0.0.2  
Protocol: TCP
Port: 22 (SSH)
Payload: 512 bytes
```

**Expected Result**:
- Threat Detected: SSH Brute Force
- Severity: Medium
- Confidence: 65%

### Scenario 3: Clean Traffic
```
Source IP: 192.168.1.200
Destination IP: 10.0.0.100
Protocol: HTTP  
Port: 8080
Payload: 2048 bytes
```

**Expected Result**: No threats detected

## 🎨 Interface Features

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Professional dark theme with blue accents
